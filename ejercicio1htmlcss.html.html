    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
    give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, <strong>dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
    pleasure, but because those who do</strong> not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that
    are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
    it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
    To take a trivial example, which of us <strong>ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
    advantage from it? </strong>But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has
    no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
